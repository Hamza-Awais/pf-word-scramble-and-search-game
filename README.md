A menu-based console game with two mini-games: unscrambling a set of jumbled words, and finding hidden words inside a 20x20 letter grid loaded from a file.

## Features
- **Word Scramble:** decode 4 scrambled words (umbrella, jacket, right, mango), with one hint allowed per word
- **Word Search:** find 5 hidden words (snake, ruler, better, caring, swing) in a 20x20 grid by entering start/end coordinates within 30 seconds
- Score increases for correct answers, decreases for wrong guesses or hints
- Score can be saved to a file and reloaded to show the last saved result
- Input checking: entering a non-numeric value where a number is expected ends the game safely

## How scoring works
- Correct word / correctly found word: +1
- Wrong word / wrong coordinates / already-used hint attempt: no repeat deduction, message shown
- Wrong guess or hint used: -1
- Score is never saved as negative (clamped to 0)
